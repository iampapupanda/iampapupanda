Write a Java program to create a base class Sports with a method called play(). Create three subclasses: Football, Basketball, and Rugby.
Override the play() method in each subclass to play a specific statement for each sport.
class Sports{
     public void play() {
         
     }
}
class Football extends Sports{
    public void play() {
        System.out.println("Play Football.");
    }
}
class Basketball extends Sports{
    public void play() {
        System.out.println("Play Basketball.");
    }
}
class Rugby extends Sports{
    public void play() {
        System.out.println("Play Rugby.");
    }
}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Football f=new Football();
		f.play();
        Basketball  b=new Basketball ();
		b.play();
        Rugby r=new Rugby();
		r.play();

    }
}
