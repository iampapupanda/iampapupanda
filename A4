Write a Java program to create an interface Playable with a method play() that takes no arguments and returns void. 
Create three classes Football, Volleyball, and Basketball that implement the Playable interface and override the play() method to play the respective sports.
interface Sports{
    public void play();
}
class Football implements Sports{
    public void play(){
        System.out.println("playing football.");
    }
}
class Basketball implements Sports{
    public void play(){
        System.out.println("playing basketball.");
    }
}
class Rugby implements Sports{
    public void play(){
        System.out.println("playing rugby.");
    }
}
public class main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Football f = new Football();
        Basketball b = new Basketball();
        Rugby r = new Rugby();
        f.play();
        b.play();
        r.play();
    }
}
